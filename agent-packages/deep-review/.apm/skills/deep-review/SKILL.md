name: deep-review
description: Run a multi-axis adversarial review of a whole repository — profile the project, agree the focus with the user in a questions file, then fan out independent review axes (tests, correctness, error model, concurrency, API compatibility, API/agent UX, protocol conformance, security, operability, architecture and others), refute every finding before it is reported, and consolidate the survivors into one ranked report. Use when the user asks for a deep, adversarial, architecture, or multi-axis review of a repository or library, or runs /deep-review. Not for reviewing a single pull request or diff — use the PR review skills for that.

# Deep review

A whole-repository review, run as several independent axes rather than one pass. Each axis has its own filter for what
counts as a finding, every finding is refuted before it survives, and the synthesizing axes (architecture, API UX) are
driven by prompts distilled from what the evidence axes actually found — not from a generic template.

The unit of work is a **dossier**: a directory holding the profile, the agreed focus, the generated prompts, the
per-axis reports, and a normalized findings file. Nothing is passed between stages as chat text. Everything is a file,
so any stage can be re-run on its own.

## Procedure

### 1. Profile the repository

Read enough to fill in a profile — do not review anything yet. Aim for 10–15 minutes of reading, not an audit.

- Build files, `README`, `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG`, CI workflows.
- The public surface: `sb surface` where the language has a resolver, otherwise `sb digest` over the source roots.
- Size and shape: `git ls-files | wc -l`, languages, module layout, test layout, `sb cycles`.
- Who consumes it, and what stability has been promised (semver? published artifact? internal only?).

Then classify the archetype against `references/archetypes.md`. The archetype selects the axes; get it right or the
review will answer questions nobody asked.

**Then list the surfaces** — the forms in which this repository exposes an API. One repository often has several:
a Kubernetes operator has `kubernetes` and usually `code-library`; a service may have `rest-http`, `events-messaging`,
and a `cli`. Each form has its own naming conventions, its own definition of a breaking change, and its own normative
source, and none of that can be derived from general principles. Available packs live in `references/surfaces/`; if a
form has no pack yet, say so in the profile rather than pretending the generic axis covers it — then write the pack
when the review proves what it needs to contain.

Create the dossier. `<skill>` below is this skill's own directory — the base directory reported when the skill loaded,
which is `~/.claude/skills/deep-review` for a personal copy and `<repo>/.claude/skills/deep-review` where `apm install`
deployed it. Use the absolute form everywhere, including in `args.skill` in step 3:

```bash
<skill>/scripts/new-dossier.sh <repo-path>
```

It prints the dossier path — use it everywhere below. Write `00-profile.md` into it: archetype, languages, public
surface, consumers, stability commitments, notable prior art in the repo (existing review reports, ADRs), and anything
that looks load-bearing.

Then write `00-commands.md` — **the commands that actually work, having run each one yourself.** Without it, every
agent re-derives the build incantation, several get it wrong, and one reports a broken build that is only a missing
flag. Most repositories do not document this correctly; a few have it in `AGENTS.md`, and where they do, verify it
rather than copying it.

Cover: build, unit tests, a single test, lint, coverage, and whatever else the axes will need. For each, give the
exact command, the working directory, the expected wall-clock time, and — this is the part that saves the agents —
every non-obvious flag with one line on why it is needed. Record the toolchain you used (JDK, Go, Node, Python
version) and any version constraint you hit. Where a command does not work at all, say so explicitly, so an agent
does not spend its budget rediscovering the failure.

A command in this file that turns out to be wrong is worse than an absent one. Run every line before you write it —
and record the exit status the way the axes will read it. **Never take `$?` from the end of a pipeline**: it is the
last command's status, so `lint … | tail; echo $?` reports `tail` succeeding and turns a failing gate into a green
one in the file every agent trusts. Redirect to a file and check the status of the command itself. The same care
applies to any wrapper that swallows a status — `|| true`, a `set +e` block, a `make` target that ends in `echo`.
This exact mistake was made on a real run and an axis built a recommendation on the false "lint is green".

**Where a tool is missing, do not accept the gap — close it.** A review that reports "helm is not installed, so the
chart was not rendered" has spent a full agent to produce nothing. Work out what the axes will need from the
repository's own build files: `helm`, `helmfile`, `kustomize`, `controller-gen`, `kubeconform`, `kind`, `terraform`,
`vals`, `sops`, a JDK of a particular major version, a coverage or mutation plugin, a language server, a fuzzer, a
protocol reference implementation. Then, in the questions file, list what is missing, what each unlocks, and how you
would install it — and install the approved ones **before** the workflow starts, never from inside an axis. An agent
that installs a toolchain mid-run burns its budget on setup, and a second agent installing the same thing
concurrently is a race nobody debugs.

**Probe for a runtime; never assert its absence.** The most damaging thing this file can say is "no cluster / no
database / no device is available", because every axis then falls back to a simulator and qualifies its conclusions
accordingly. On a measured run the profiler wrote exactly that and had never checked: there was a live cluster with
the relevant CRDs already installed, and three axes went on to report a defect that only the fake client can produce
while a verifier wrongly refuted a real one the fake could not see. Run the probe, whatever the archetype implies —
`kubectl config current-context` and `kubectl get nodes`, `kind get clusters`, `docker ps`, a connection to the
database the tests expect — and record what answered. If a runtime does exist, say what it is, what is already
installed on it, and the rules for using it: create and delete your own namespace or schema, change nothing shared,
and never install or upgrade something the user depends on.

Two things stay true regardless. Install into a user-scoped location (`GOBIN=~/go/bin`, a Homebrew formula, a
`bin/` inside your throwaway worktree) rather than anywhere that changes the machine for other work; and pin the
version the repository asks for, since a newer `controller-gen` or `kubeconform` will report drift that is the
tool's, not the code's. Record in `00-commands.md` what you installed, at which version, and what it made possible.

Where the user declines an install, say so in `00-focus.md` and name the axis that will be weaker for it — that is a
coverage limitation, and the report must carry it rather than quietly omitting a section.

**Find the configuration where it actually lives, not where it ought to be.** A glob over the repository root is how
you conclude that a project has no lint configuration while CI has been enforcing one for a year — a mistake made on
a real run of this pipeline, in the one file every agent trusts. Three habits prevent it:

- **Ask the tool, not the filesystem.** `golangci-lint config path`, `npm config list`, `mvn help:effective-pom`,
  `helm template --debug`, `pytest --co -q` with the config echoed. The tool knows which file it will read; a
  directory listing only tells you which files exist. The two answers differ more often than you would think — in
  the case above, `.github/linters/.golangci.yml` existed *and* the tool ignored it, because it searches the working
  directory and its parents.
- **Search the whole tree.** Configuration hides in `.github/`, `.github/linters/`, `build/`, `ci/`, `hack/`,
  `config/`, tool-specific directories, and inside the build file itself (a `pom.xml` plugin block, a Gradle
  convention plugin, a `package.json` key).
- **Follow the configuration out of the repository.** CI routinely loads it from elsewhere: a checkout of an
  organization-level `.github` repository, a reusable workflow referenced as `uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/x@ref`,
  a shared chart, a base image, an organization Renovate or Dependabot preset. Fetch those and read them — they
  decide what actually runs on a pull request. Record where each configuration came from and **at which ref**: a
  shared config pinned to a moving `main` is a supply-chain fact worth a finding on its own, and it means the rules
  can change without a commit in this repository.

When local and CI configuration differ, say so explicitly in `00-commands.md` and name both. An axis told "there is
no configuration" will report the absence as a defect, and it will be wrong in a way that is expensive to unpick.

The file is yours alone: agents read it and never write to it. When one of them finds a correction, it writes
`work/commands-<axis>.md` instead, and later axes read those alongside the baseline. Fold the worthwhile ones back
into `00-commands.md` during the post-mortem — that is how the next review of this repository starts ahead of this
one. Do not let agents append to a shared file: several axes run concurrently, and one read-and-rewrite discards the
others' lines.

### 2. Agree the focus in a questions file

Write `questions.md` into the dossier. **Pre-fill every answer with your recommendation**, so the user can accept the
whole file by saying so and only edit what they disagree with. Structure:

```markdown
## 1. Archetype
<your classification and why>
**Answer:** protocol library

## 2. Axes to run
| Axis | Run? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protocol-conformance | yes | the point of the library |
| deployment-config | no | nothing is deployed |
**Answer:** as above

## 3. Where does it hurt today?
...
**Answer:** <your guess, or "unknown">
```

Cover, at minimum: archetype; surfaces; axes in and out with a one-line reason each; known pain points and past
incidents; what is explicitly out of scope; the stability contract (may the API change?); how deep to go (rough agent
budget); models per phase; whether to include a second opinion on the top findings.

**And a runtime section, always — even when you found nothing.** Probing (step 1) tells you what exists; only the
user can tell you what may be touched, and the two questions have different answers far more often than not. Report
what the probe found, **what is already living in it**, and then ask:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| A runtime exists and is empty or clearly disposable | May the axes use it? State the rules you propose — own namespace, own schema, deleted afterwards, nothing shared modified. |
| A runtime exists and is somebody's working environment | Say so plainly and recommend **against** using it. A cluster running real workloads is not a test bed, and an axis given permission will happily install a CRD into it. Offer a disposable one instead. |
| No runtime exists | May one be created — `kind create cluster`, a compose file, a container, testcontainers? For an operator or a service this is usually the highest-value item in the whole questions file. |

Never let "no runtime" survive as an unexamined premise: it is the caveat that quietly degrades every axis at once,
because each falls back to a simulator whose behavior differs from the real thing in ways it will not notice.

Then stop and ask the user to edit the file inline and say when it is ready. Do not use `AskUserQuestion` for this —
the questions are interdependent and the user needs to see them together. Use `AskUserQuestion` only if the user's
edited file leaves a genuine contradiction.

When the user is done, read the file back and write `00-focus.md`: the resolved decisions only, no questions. That file
is what every agent reads.

### 3. Run the pipeline

```
Workflow({
  scriptPath: "<skill>/workflow/deep-review.js",   // absolute, no ~
  args: { dossier, repo, skill: "<skill>", surfaces: [...], axes: [...], models: {...}, completenessCritic: true }
})
```

`args.skill` is required, and the script throws without it: every axis prompt points its agent at reference packs
under that directory, and an agent that cannot resolve them reviews from memory instead.

`surfaces` is the list from step 1, e.g. `["kubernetes", "code-library"]`. Every axis is told to read those packs and
to obey the ownership table inside them; the distiller additionally carries their architectural questions into the
synthesis prompt. Leave it out only when the repository genuinely exposes no API — which is rarer than it looks.

Build `args.axes` from the focus file. Each entry:

```json
{ "key": "concurrency-lifecycle", "phase": "evidence", "needsWriteAccess": true, "agentType": null, "model": null }
```

Set `needsWriteAccess: true` for any axis that has to change the project to measure it — `tests` (coverage plugin,
mutation run), `correctness` (reproduction tests), `performance` (benchmark harness), `protocol-conformance` (fuzzer),
`api-compatibility` (building against the previous release). Axes that only read leave it off.

**Also pass `sessionRepoIsTarget: true` when, and only when, this session's own repository is the one under review.**
Harness worktree isolation copies the *session's* repository, so on a cross-repository review it drops the agent into
an unrelated checkout. With the flag absent, the workflow skips harness isolation and instructs each write-access axis
to create its own worktree of the target repository under `work/<axis>-wt` instead. Getting this wrong is not a
cosmetic problem: an agent either reviews the wrong codebase or silently writes into the user's real working tree.

`phase` is one of three:

- `scout` — cheap and broad, runs first behind a barrier because the others read its output. `tests` and
  `dependencies` belong here.
- `evidence` — the main axes. They run concurrently and each is refuted as soon as it finishes.
- `synthesis` — `architecture`, and `api-ux` when there is review history to distil from. A distiller agent writes
  `prompts/<axis>.md` from the evidence reports first, then the axis runs on that prompt.

Order inside a phase does not matter. Every axis is followed by an adversarial verifier that appends
`work/findings-<axis>.jsonl` and moves refuted findings into a closing section of the report rather than deleting
them.

**Leave `agentType` unset.** The specialized reviewers (`security-reviewer`, `protocol-compatibility-reviewer`,
`backward-compatibility-reviewer` and the rest) are built for reviewing a diff and their system prompts fight the
axis instructions: measured on this pipeline, `protocol-compatibility-reviewer` failed twice — once refusing over a
working-directory mismatch the other axes worked around, once emitting a placeholder structured output as its second
action, which ends the agent with an empty result that looks like "ran, found nothing". Use the default workflow
subagent unless you have evidence a specialist does better on a whole-repository axis.

Models: default everything to `sonnet` while debugging the pipeline. For a real run:

```json
{ "default": "opus", "refute": "opus", "consolidate": "opus", "critic": "opus" }
```

with `"model": "fable"` on `correctness`, `concurrency-lifecycle`, `protocol-conformance`, and `architecture`;
`"model": "opus"` on `security` (fable declines vulnerability work); `"model": "sonnet"` on the tool-driving axes —
`tests`, `dependencies`, `docs-onboarding`, `build-release`.

`models.refute` deserves its own thought. Measured on a 12-axis run, the verifiers cost 35% of the whole budget and
returned zero rejections and two downgrades out of 128 findings, because half of them "verified" by re-reading the
lines the finding already quoted. Buying a stronger model does not fix that — the confidence rule below does. Keep
verification on `opus` and watch the executed-versus-read rate the consolidator reports; if it stays near zero, the
prompt is still wrong and no model will save it.

**Confidence is assigned by the verifier, never by the axis that raised the finding.** An axis reports `method`
(`executed` / `traced` / `inferred`) and its `evidence`; the verifier may stamp `CONFIRMED` only when it executed
something itself. That is what makes the label mean anything, and it is also the verifier's one unambiguous job — it
can always decide whether it ran something, whereas "is this finding wrong" invites agreement.

The workflow writes `reports/<axis>.md`, `prompts/<axis>.md` for synthesis axes, `findings.jsonl`, and `synthesis.md`.
It returns counts only — read the files.

### 4. Triage

Read `synthesis.md`, then the reports behind anything that matters. For each finding, set `verdict` and, when
rejecting, a typed `rejection_reason` in `findings.jsonl`:

| `rejection_reason` | Meaning | Where the fix goes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `convention` | A rule that lives outside the code: platform guarantee, CI behavior, deliberate team decision | `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` |
| `guard-missed` | The code does handle it; the reviewer missed the guard | A comment next to the guard |
| `out-of-scope` | Real, but not this review's question | The axis file or `common-rules.md` |
| `model-error` | Fabrication | Nowhere |
| `accepted-debt` | Correct, and not being fixed | An ADR |

### 4a. Sweep after every run

An agent that dies mid-run — a dropped API connection, a timeout, a kill — never reaches its own teardown, so
anything it created outlives it. Harness-managed worktrees are cleaned up for you; everything an agent made itself is
not. After each pass, check and clean:

```bash
git -C <repo> worktree list          # remove any under <dossier>/work/
git -C <repo> status --porcelain     # must be empty
kind get clusters                    # and the equivalent for any other runtime
docker ps -a                         # containers a test harness started
```

Do this before re-running, too: an axis that retries will try to create the worktree or the cluster it already
created and fail on a name collision, which then looks like a second, different failure.

### 5. Re-run what was wrong, not everything

A bad axis prompt costs one stage, not the run: fix `prompts/<axis>.md` or the axis file, then re-invoke with
`{scriptPath, resumeFromRunId}`. The unchanged prefix comes back from cache.

### 6. Post-mortem

Group the `convention` rejections and propose a concrete diff to the project's `AGENTS.md`. Phrase each rule as a fact
with its reason, never as an instruction to suppress findings, and give it a falsification hook: *"X is guaranteed by
the platform, so callers do not validate it — but a path that forwards X into a URL before canonicalization is still a
bug."* A rule that only says "do not report this" will hide the real defect when it eventually arrives.

Rules that need a paragraph go into a linked document, not into `AGENTS.md` itself, which is loaded into every session
and has a context budget. Group `out-of-scope` rejections separately and fix the axis files — that is how the skill
gets better.

## Files

- `references/common-rules.md` — evidence bar, falsification, confidence labels, severity ladder. Every axis prompt
  includes it verbatim.
- `references/report-format.md` — the report and finding block shape. Also included verbatim.
- `references/archetypes.md` — archetype to axis mapping.
- `references/axes/<key>.md` — one file per axis: its filter, its questions, its rejection rules.
- `references/surfaces/<form>.md` — one file per API form: the normative source, the form-specific checks, what counts
  as a breaking change there, the tooling, and an ownership table routing each concern to the axis that owns it.
  Cross-cutting by design: several axes read the same pack.
- `workflow/deep-review.js` — the pipeline.
- `scripts/new-dossier.sh` — dossier layout.

## Rules for this skill itself

- Never run an axis whose file does not exist. Adding an axis means writing its file first.
- Never skip the questions file. A review with the wrong focus is more expensive than no review: it produces a long
  document that has to be read before it can be discarded.
- The dossier lives at `<repo>/.review/<date>/` and is gitignored by the setup script. Do not put it in a session
  scratchpad — the point is that it outlives the session.
- Report honestly what did not run. If an axis produced nothing because the agent failed, say so; do not let a missing
  section read as a clean bill of health.
