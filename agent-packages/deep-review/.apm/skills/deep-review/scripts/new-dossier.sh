# Review dossier — $name

| File | Written by | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`00-profile.md\` | session, stage 1 | archetype, surface, consumers, stability commitments |
| \`00-commands.md\` | session, stage 1 | build, test, and tooling commands that were executed and work; read-only for agents |
| \`work/commands-<axis>.md\` | agents | corrections to the above — one file per axis, never a shared append |
| \`work/raw-<axis>.jsonl\` | axis agent | findings exactly as raised, before verification |
| \`questions.md\` | session, stage 2 | focus questions with pre-filled answers; the user edits this in place |
| \`00-focus.md\` | session, stage 2 | resolved decisions only — every agent reads this |
| \`prompts/<axis>.md\` | workflow | distilled prompts for synthesis axes |
| \`reports/<axis>.md\` | workflow | one report per axis |
| \`findings.jsonl\` | workflow, then triage | normalized findings; triage adds \`verdict\` and \`rejection_reason\` |
| \`synthesis.md\` | workflow | deduplicated, ranked, cross-axis view |
| \`work/\` | agents | scratch space: reproductions, scanner output, benchmarks |

Rejection reasons used during triage: \`convention\`, \`guard-missed\`, \`out-of-scope\`, \`model-error\`,
\`accepted-debt\`. See the \`deep-review\` skill for what each one implies.
